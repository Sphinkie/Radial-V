# EAGLE Scripts

These EAGLE script has to be copied into the `/scr` folder of Eagle (ex: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Eagle-7.4.0\scr`).

* **export-layouts.scr** =  Generate three PNG files: Layer-Top, Layer-Bottom, and Components
* **print-layers.scr** = Print three layers: Layer-Top, Layer-Bottom, and Components


They can be called from the EAGLE menu, in order to generate the PNG needed for making the pcb boards.



 


> EAGLE Script files are a powerful tool. They can contain long sequences of commands, such as the specification of specific colors and fill-patterns for layers. Since every EAGLE operation can be carried out with the help of text commands, you can, for example, import data or configure EAGLE with the aid of script files.
